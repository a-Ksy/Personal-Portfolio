              skills. I enjoy using my creativity while working and also
              in my daily life. That's why I have a passion for cooking
              and music. I'm also a DJ at my school radio. My mindset is
              to be friendly and helpful as much as possible; hence, I

      As interns from different departments and specialties our aim was to deliver a product that targets a healthy post-COVID office life. To achieve
      that, we've developed social distance controllers, an infection tracking - contact tracing algorithm, smart labeling system, and limiting people per m2. We've
      used social distance controller wristbands that vibrate under 2 meters and collect the contact information which is later sent to AWS. Our backend derives the
      contact information which provides helpful statistics to the client side (a Flutter mobile app and a React.js web app). I participated in the backend and web
      development. My main contributions are building a non-relational database (Dynamodb) for contact data, initializing API gateways for client integration,
      implementing Authentication with Active Directory using AWS Cognito, implementing many different lambda functions (mostly API functions for the client side),
      building a web app using React.js, Redux, Thunk, SCSS while following Airbnb Eslint practice.`,
